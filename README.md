## hi!! i'm sarah (she/her, 19, cs major @ uconn)

welcome to my github!! i started developing around first year of HS as a hobby and it **really** stuck with me ^^;

you can take a look around if you want, some of my repos are pretty silly but here's a few of my favs!

## notable repos!

#### [sushicat.rocks](https://github.com/sarahkittyy/sushicat.rocks)

a silly lil personal app i made to test out random web dev things, like a sandbox of sorts! no particular theme, i just add things that i feel would be fun to develop, but maybe don't deserve their own repo >w<

made with vue + mongodb + express + typescript &lt;3

#### [mrboard.sushicat.rocks](https://github.com/sarahkittyy/mrboard)

a full-stack app i developed for a small little game i like called marble race!

the game has built-in levels, and user-created levels, but only the default levels have leaderboards. so, i built this site for people to upload their game replay files! it's a sort of *"unofficial leaderboard"* ^^

made with vue + mysql + express + typescript + vuetify &lt;3

#### [kibby-os](https://github.com/sarahkittyy/kibby-os)

a WIP x86 operating system i'm developing in spare time. currently implements paging, interrupts, key handling, etc.

my goal is to implement multi-process support, add a c compiler, a filesystem, and a text editor, and allow myself to fully write code *for* the os, *inside* the os.

made with C + assembly &lt;3

#### [voxels](https://github.com/sarahkittyy/voxels)

when i first started learning c++ i always wanted to get into opengl, so i took a while and taught myself a decent bit!

i used that knowledge to create a small little voxel engine (think [minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/))!

made with cpp + opengl &lt;3

#### [bq-r](https://github.com/sarahkittyy/bq-r)

my favorite genre of games as a kid were platformers with level editors!! so when i found out my favorite game from back then, [blockquest](https://blockquest.net), had shut down, i wanted to re-make it

it's currently **WIP**, and i'm developing it side-by-side with a friend of mine ^^

made with cpp + [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) + [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/) + [box2d](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d) &lt;3
