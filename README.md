## hi!! i'm sarah (she/her, 22)

welcome to my github!! i started developing around first year of HS as a hobby and it **really** stuck with me ^^;

you can take a look around if you want, some of my repos are pretty silly but here's a few of my favs!

## notable repos!

#### [blockquest-remake](https://sarahkittyy.itch.io/blockquest-remake)

an online level-sharing platformer community. players sign up, build levels, submit them, play eachother's levels, set records, and vote for the best  levels. 

frontend/game in c++ with SFML, ImGui, backend uses express/postgres/prisma

try it! download the game [here](https://sarahkittyy.itch.io/blockquest-remake)

#### [mrboard.sushicat.rocks](https://github.com/sarahkittyy/mrboard)

a full-stack app i developed for a small little game i like called marble race!

the game has built-in levels, and user-created levels, but only the default levels have leaderboards. so, i built this site for people to upload their game replay files! it's a sort of *"unofficial leaderboard"* ^^

made with vue + mysql + express + typescript + vuetify &lt;3

#### [p2pg](https://github.com/sarahkittyy/p2pg)

A 2d top-down multiplayer combat game with a simple gameplay loop. Plays in browser on both mobile and PC.

Connections are fully peer-2-peer. Uses deterministic gameplay logic to rollback and resimulate the game when opponents go out of sync, leading to a very smooth real-time experience.

Written in rust with [bevy](bevyengine.org/), and [ggrs](https://github.com/gschup/ggrs/), and compiled to WASM.

#### [kibby-os](https://github.com/sarahkittyy/kibby-os)

a WIP x86 operating system i'm developing in spare time. currently implements paging, interrupts, key handling, etc.

my goal is to implement multi-process support, add a c compiler, a filesystem, and a text editor, and allow myself to fully write code *for* the os, *inside* the os.

made with C + assembly &lt;3

#### [voxels](https://github.com/sarahkittyy/voxels)

when i first started learning c++ i always wanted to get into opengl, so i took a while and taught myself a decent bit!

i used that knowledge to create a small little voxel engine (think [minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/))!
